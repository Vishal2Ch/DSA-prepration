üîπ What is Operator Overloading?

Operator Overloading means giving additional meaning to existing operators (like +, -, *, etc.)
when used with user-defined types (like classes or objects).

Java does NOT support operator overloading (except one small exception with + for strings).

So, this is not allowed in Java:

MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();
MyClass obj2 = new MyClass();
MyClass obj3 = obj1 + obj2;  // ‚ùå Error: operator '+' cannot be applied

‚úÖ The only exception: String Concatenation

Java overloads the + operator only for String types.

String name = "Vishal";
System.out.println("Hello " + name); // ‚úÖ '+' joins strings


Behind the scenes, Java converts it to:

System.out.println(new StringBuilder("Hello ").append(name));
